# X-Team 51 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks



## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We will track progress by setting goals and making sure everyone is on the 
same page as far as completion of the assignment.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

We will communicate primarily through texting. If someone is having difficulty with a task, 
they will be able to message other team members for assistance. 

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
We will send texts to each other about deadline reminders and put the dates in our calenders. We will also create mini deadlines to meet and check on each other's progress.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
